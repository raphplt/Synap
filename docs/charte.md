## Brand Essence

### Positioning

SYNAP transforms passive consumption into active cognition.  
The brand communicates intelligence without pretension,  
focus without rigidity, energy without chaos.

Every visual decision serves clarity and purpose.  
Nothing is decorative. Everything reinforces the core promise:  
your attention becomes growth.

### Core Attributes

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Intelligent | Thoughtful, never condescending |
| Focused | Intentional, not restrictive |
| Confident | Self-assured, not aggressive |
| Premium | Quality, not luxury |
| Modern | Contemporary, not trendy |
| Accessible | Clear, not simplified |

### Visual Intent

The visual language operates in a premium dark environment where contrast is functional,  
color is signal, and motion is feedback. Typography creates hierarchy without decoration.  
Spacing allows density without clutter. The interface feels fluid but controlled,  
energetic but calm. Technology disappears into experience.

---

## Typography System

Typography creates hierarchy and rhythm. The system uses a modern sans-serif
with excellent legibility at small sizes and strong presence at large scales.
Weight and size create emphasis—never decoration.

### Primary Typeface

**Inter** — Designed for screen legibility with a tall x-height and open apertures.  
Use for all interface text, body copy, and data.

**Weights in use**
- Regular (400) — Body text
- Medium (500) — Emphasis, labels
- Semibold (600) — Headlines, titles

### Type Scale

| Name | Size | Weight | Usage | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Display | `3.5rem` | `600` | Hero sections, major announcements | Transform Your Mind |
| Headline 1 | `2.5rem` | `600` | Page titles, section headers | Your Daily Progress |
| Headline 2 | `2rem` | `600` | Card titles, modal headers | Learning Paths |
| Headline 3 | `1.5rem` | `600` | Subsection titles | Active Goals |
| Body Large | `1.125rem` | `400` | Prominent body text, descriptions | Continue building your knowledge network through consistent daily practice. |
| Body | `1rem` | `400` | Standard body text, UI labels | Your progress is tracked automatically as you engage with content. |
| Body Small | `0.875rem` | `400` | Secondary information, captions | Updated 5 minutes ago |
| Caption | `0.75rem` | `500` | Metadata, timestamps, tags | NEUROSCIENCE • 12 MIN READ |

### Typography Principles

**Hierarchy**
- Create clear information hierarchy through size and weight.
- Each level has a distinct role. Avoid intermediate sizes.

**Readability**
- Line length: 50–75 characters.
- Line height: 1.5–1.6 for body text.
- Letter spacing: default for body, `-1%` for headlines.

**Consistency**
- Never use arbitrary sizes. Stick to the defined scale.
- Typography is systematic, not creative.

### Text Color Application

- Primary Text — Pure White (`#FFFFFF`): Headlines, primary body text, high-emphasis content
- Secondary Text — Light Zinc (`#D4D4D8`): Supporting information, descriptions, subheadings
- Tertiary Text — Medium Zinc (`#71717A`): Metadata, timestamps, low-priority information
- Disabled Text — Dark Zinc (`#52525B`): Inactive elements, placeholders, disabled states

## Layout & Spacing Principles

Spacing creates breathing room without waste. The system uses an 8-point grid
for consistency and mathematical harmony. Density is achieved through precise
spacing, not cramming.

### Spacing Scale

| Token | Value | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| XXS | `4px` | Tight groupings |
| XS | `8px` | Related elements |
| SM | `12px` | Component padding |
| MD | `16px` | Standard spacing |
| LG | `24px` | Section spacing |
| XL | `32px` | Major sections |
| 2XL | `48px` | Page sections |
| 3XL | `64px` | Major breaks |

### Grid System

**8-Point Grid Foundation**  
All dimensions, spacing, and sizing use multiples of 8. This creates
mathematical harmony and makes scaling predictable across screen sizes.

**12-column grid** with `16px` gutters (`2 × 8px` base unit).

### Container Widths

| Device | Max width | Padding | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mobile | `100%` | `16px` | `< 768px` |
| Tablet | `768px` | `24px` | `768px - 1024px` |
| Desktop | `1200px` | `32px` | `> 1024px` |
| Wide | `1440px` | `48px` | Large displays |

### Core Layout Rules

**Density Without Clutter**
- Use whitespace intentionally, not excessively
- Group related elements with tighter spacing
- Separate sections with consistent breaks
- Content should feel substantial, not sparse

**Alignment & Rhythm**
- Maintain vertical rhythm through consistent spacing
- Align elements to the grid
- Use center alignment sparingly
- Text always aligns left (for LTR languages)

**Card & Container Design**
- Cards use `#141414` on `#0A0A0A` background
- Subtle 1px borders with `#3F3F46`
- Standard padding: `16–24px`
- Border radius: `8px` (consistent)

**Responsive Behavior**
- Mobile-first approach
- Reduce spacing on smaller screens
- Stack columns on mobile
- Maintain touch target size (`44px` minimum)

## Iconography Style

Icons are functional tools, not decorative elements. They guide attention,
indicate state, and support comprehension. The style is minimal, geometric,
and consistent.

### Specifications

- Style: Outline / Stroke
- Stroke Width: `2px`
- Corner Radius: Rounded (`2px`)
- Standard Size: `24 × 24px`
- Small Size: `16 × 16px`
- Large Size: `32 × 32px`

### Color Usage

- White: Default state, primary icons
- Cyan: Interactive, active states
- Green: Success, completion
- Zinc: Disabled, inactive states

### Icon Library Reference (labels)

- Cognition
- Connections
- Progress
- Focus
- Energy
- Insights
- Status
- Container
- Navigation
- Complete
- Close
- Add
- Remove
- Visible
- Hidden
- Search

### Icon Principles

**Functional Only**  
Icons must serve a purpose: navigation, status indication, or action trigger.
Never decorative. If it doesn't aid comprehension, remove it.

**Consistent Geometry**  
All icons share the same stroke weight, corner radius, and optical weight.
Source from a single icon family (e.g., Lucide, Phosphor).

**Semantic Color**  
Icon color must match its semantic meaning. Active elements use cyan,
success uses green, disabled uses zinc. Never arbitrary colors.

## Motion & Animation Principles

Motion serves comprehension and feedback, never decoration. Animations are fast,
subtle, and natural. They guide attention, confirm actions, and maintain spatial
relationships during transitions.

### Duration Standards

- Micro interactions: `100–150ms`
- State changes: `200–250ms`
- Element transitions: `300–400ms`
- View transitions: `400–500ms`

Rule: Smaller elements move faster. Larger transitions take more time.

### Easing Functions

- Ease-out: `cubic-bezier(0, 0, 0.2, 1)` — Default. Elements entering or appearing.
- Ease-in: `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 1, 1)` — Elements exiting or disappearing.
- Ease-in-out: `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)` — Position changes, transforms, smooth movements.

### Animation Types

| Type | Duration | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fade | `200–300ms` | Content appearance, tooltips |
| Slide | `300–400ms` | Navigation, panels, drawers |
| Scale | `150–200ms` | Button press, modal appear |
| Progress | `400–500ms` | Loading, completion, steps |

### Motion Principles

**Purposeful**
- Confirms user actions
- Shows system status
- Guides focus
- Never decorative

**Fast & Subtle**
- Micro: `100–150ms`
- Standard: `200–300ms`
- Complex: `300–500ms`
- Never exceed `500ms`

**Natural Movement**
- Use appropriate easing
- No linear animations
- Respect physics
- Feel organic

### Common Use Cases

| Context | Motion | Duration | Easing |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Button Press | Scale (0.98) + Color change | `100ms` | ease-out |
| Card Hover | Translate Y (-2px) + Shadow increase | `150ms` | ease-out |
| Modal Appear | Fade + Scale (0.95 → 1) | `250ms` | ease-out |
| Page Transition | Fade + Slide (16px) | `400ms` | ease-in-out |
| Success Feedback | Scale pulse + Color flash | `300ms` | ease-out |
| Loading State | Opacity pulse or skeleton shimmer | `1000ms loop` | ease-in-out |

### Accessibility Consideration

Always respect the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query. When enabled, reduce or eliminate
animations, using instant state changes or simple fades instead.

## Illustration & Imagery Direction

Visual content must be abstract, conceptual, and aligned with cognitive themes.
No literal representations. No stock photography. No cartoon illustrations.
Imagery supports the idea of mental transformation and neural connections.

### Approved Visual Metaphors

| Concept | Description | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Neural Networks | Abstract nodes and connections, flow diagrams, mesh patterns | Dot grids, connecting lines, network graphs |
| Flow & Progression | Directional movement, gradual build-up, pathways | Arrow flows, gradient bars, ascending patterns |
| Signal & Energy | Pulses, waves, electrical patterns, subtle glows | Line graphs, waveforms, glow effects |
| Abstract Cognition | Geometric interpretation of thought, processing, insights | Layered shapes, intersecting planes, particle systems |
| Data Visualization | Progress charts, metrics, clean infographics | Bar charts, line graphs, circular progress |
| Minimal Geometry | Simple shapes with purposeful arrangement | Circles, squares, grids, subtle patterns |

### Illustration Style Guidelines

**Visual Characteristics**
- Geometric and abstract, never literal
- Line-based or minimal fills
- Monochromatic or limited color (cyan accent)
- Clean, precise execution
- Low contrast, subtle presence
- No gradients (except functional progress)
- No textures or noise

**Technical Approach**
- SVG format for all illustrations
- Optimized file sizes
- Scalable without quality loss

---

## Visual Consistency Rules

These rules ensure consistent application of the SYNAP brand across all touchpoints.
Adherence to these standards creates a cohesive, recognizable identity.

### Design Decision Framework

When making design decisions, ask these questions in order:

1. Is this functional or decorative?  
   If decorative, remove it. Every element must serve a purpose.
2. Does this use color semantically?  
   Color must communicate meaning, not aesthetic preference.
3. Does this follow the spacing system?  
   All dimensions must be multiples of 8px from the grid.
4. Is the typography hierarchy clear?  
   Size and weight create hierarchy. Never arbitrary emphasis.
5. Would this work on a dark background?  
   Dark mode is primary. Design for dark first, adapt for light.
6. Is this minimal but expressive?  
   Communicate clearly with the fewest elements possible.
